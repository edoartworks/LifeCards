# LifeCards
is about connecting deeper with friends, lovers or strangers.

You decide how to play.  
Ask and answer questions.   
Let the conversation flow.   

Respect others' boundaries,  
and your own boundaries.

Have courage.  
Be open.  
Be vulnerable.  
Dare to trust.

Inspired by the game "Spark" by Yes Theory, and many other similar ones.

### Note to developers ðŸ¤–
Developed using Godot Engine [ https://godotengine.org/ ]

So I haven't really made an effort so far to make this project easy to contribute to. But I definitely will if there is enough interest :)
